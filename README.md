This repository stores the code for analysis of AGRRA reporting activities in Belize done in whole or part by UB-ERI. Specific reporting instances/projects are stored in their own dedicated folders.

## 2026 - Atolls Report

This project analyzes AGRRA data for Turneffe Atoll and Lighthouse Atoll, producing analyses and figures for reporting. To run this project, drop your copy of Lighthouse Atoll AGRRA data into the data_deposit subfolder. Turneffe data will be automatically downloaded from Dryad, so there is no need to upload this data as well. Open project_run.r, and run the script. Results will be located in the outputs subfolder.
